Implementing coding practice in python using
PEP8.

It gets difficult to understand a messed up handwriting, similarly an unreadable and
unstructured code is not accepted by all. However, you can benefit as a programmer only
when you can express better with your code. This is where PEP comes to the rescue.
Python Enhancement Proposal or PEP is a design document which provides information to
the Python community and also describes new features and document aspects, such as style
and design for Python.
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language which is easy to learn and has gained
popularity in the fields of Data Science and Web Development over a few years and PEP 8 is
called the style code of Python. It was written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and
Nick Coghlan in the year 2001. It focuses on enhancing Pythonâ€™s code readability and
consistency. Join the certification course on Python Programming and gain skills and
knowledge about various features of Python along with tips and tricks.
