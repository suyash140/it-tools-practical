c) Create a page 
To contribute to a Wiki, you'll start by creating a page. All pages have a title 
and text. Unlike pages of a normal website, you won't need to know any code 
to contribute content here. You can write and format text on a Wiki page like 
you would an email. 
When you're done, all you have to do is click “Submit” to save the page and it
can immediately be read by anyone.

d) Edit a page 
Published pages can be edited by anyone that reads them. If, for 
example, you notice that a page created by someone else contains 
inaccurate/outdated information, you can open the editing screen 
and correct that information directly. Just “Submit”, and the page's 
contents will update immediately.
